# GreenLedger AI - 3 Minute Pitch Presentation

---

## 🎯 **OPENING (0:00 - 0:15)**

**"Imagine if every Indian home and business could instantly know their carbon footprint and access government subsidies for renewable energy — all through a simple conversation."**

That's GreenLedger. We're building India's most trusted digital sustainability advisor, combining AI-powered carbon tracking with actionable renewable energy recommendations.

## 📊 **THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:45)**

Today, India faces a critical challenge:

- **50% of small businesses** don't track their carbon emissions
- **Complex government schemes** exist but are hard to access
- **Renewable energy adoption** is slow due to lack of awareness and ROI clarity
- **No single platform** connects carbon tracking, renewable solutions, and subsidies

Small entities — homes, schools, shops — are left in the dark about their environmental impact and financial opportunities.
